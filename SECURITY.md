# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Always use the most recent release version. 
There will be no security updates or patches for outdated releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you identify a vulnerability, please consider that this may affect other
people/projects as well. This in mind, please email me (Yannic Labonte
<yannic.labonte@gmail.com>) first, so I can react and hopefully fix the issue,
before it is published to the public (e.g. in a github issue) and could be
misused by a third party.
